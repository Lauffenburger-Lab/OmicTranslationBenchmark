## Algorithms for the pre-processing of the raw data
1. preprocessingL1000.R: Script to pre-process and estimate the quality of the raw transcriptomic data for a pair of cell-lines.
2. AddSequentiallyCells.R: Script to add one more cell-line each time.
3. controlSigs.R: Pre-process data to add control transcriptomic signatures.
4. LoadExternalData.R: Load extra data from GEO.

The produced data are used to create the figures stored in the figures folder and the results in the results folder.
