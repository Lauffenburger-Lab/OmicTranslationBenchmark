## Data description
1. level5_beta_trt_cp_n720216x12328.gctx : The transformed gene expression data of experiments of drugs tested on specific cancer cell-lines.
2. geneinfo_beta.txt : Meta-data information about the measured and infered (in the platform) genes
3. siginfo_beta.txt : Meta-data information about the each experiment/sample. Each experiment/sample is identified by a unique sig_id.
4. LINCS2020 Release Metadata Field Definitions.xlsx : It contains in detail description of each file of the L1000 and the variables seen inside them.
5. CCLE folder: It contains the sequenced cell line data from the CCLE dataset[^1]
