## Data
The data required to run this script are coming from 4 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets:
a. Human lung fibrosis[^1]
b. Mouse lung fibrosis[^2]
c. Mouse lung fibrosis[^3] external test set
d. Human liver cirrhosis[^4]

The files are too big to be uploaded and are available upon reasonable request.

## Folder structure
1. **10foldcrossval_lung** : Folder containing the 10-fold cross-validation split data.
