## Machine and Deep learning algorithms of the project
1. Autoencoder.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train an autoencoder, evaluate it with 10-fold cross validation and get embeddings in the latent space.
2. models.py: Contains classes to define layers for the autoencoder and the encoder and decoder models.
3. evaluationUtils.py: Contains functions for evaluation of the models.
4. trainingUtils.py: Contains function to train a variational autoencoder with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion.
