## Produced figures of the study
Here we have stored the figures and the scripts that produce them:
1. AutoencodersFinalComparePlot.ipynb: Compare the performance of different ANN models.
2. AutoencodersFinalComparePlotLandmarks.ipynb : Compare the performance of different ANN models, but using only the landmark genes in the L1000 datasets.

The above scripts are for Figure 1b-1c. The rest of the plots are a result of the scripts in the postprocessing folder.
