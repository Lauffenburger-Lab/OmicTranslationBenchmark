# OmicTranslationBenchmark

The clinical translation of animal models is generally poor. Thus, there is a need for computational approaches to translate omics' signatures into different cell-types, species etc. In this study we modified and combined neural network approaches and compared them with other approaches to build a benchmark for omics' translation. Specifically, we evaluate the dependecy of each approach with the total sample size, the sample size per different entity and the number of different entities required to build a common latent space. Finally, we developed a novel approach to evaluate the important genes to translate each signature into the commono latent space as well as which genes are entity-specific.

The current repository contains code for:
1. Initial evaluation of the quality and preprocessing of the data.
2. Embeddings evaluations of the autoencoder models.
3. Deep learning models (autoencoder's approaches) to translate transcriptomic profiles betweem different cell-types.
4. Importance estimation of each gene to translate between cell-types or to encode into the a Global Cell-line Latent Space.

## Data
The transcriptomic signatures (level 5 profiles) of the L1000 CMap resource[^4] are used for this study, together with data from the KEGG database[^5] (accessed via the Bioconductor resource[^6]).

The transcriptomic profiles were generated by measuring 978 important (landmark) genes in cancer with a luminex bead-based assay and computationally infering the rest[^4]. 

**Details on how to access these data can be found in the data folder**, but generally the main resources can be accessed [here](https://clue.io/data/CMap2020?fbclid=IwAR1Uc379nDYELH8lYU9MPI9TiAT3054_55g72Ymbgm7FAW7WZnPD3YBCXeI#LINCS2020)

## Folder structure
1. **data** : Folder that should contain the raw data of the study.
2. **figures** : Folder containing the scripts to produce the figures of the study (also containing the figures).
3. **learning** : Folder containing machine and deep learning and machine learning algorithms and models.
4. **preprocessing** : Folder containing scripts to pre-process the raw data and evaluate their quality.
	* **preprocessed_data** : Here the pre-processed data to be used in subsequent analysis are stored.
5. **results** : Here the results of a subsequent analysis should be stored.
6. **postprocessing** : Folder containing scripts to evaluate models' embeddings and genes' importance.

## Installation
The study utilizes multiple resources from the Python and R programming languages.

**R dependencies**: 

If you want, you can run the setup_rlibs.R script in Rstudio or any R command line environment.

This will install **the latest versions of the libraries used (not the specific ones that were used in the study)**.

**Please keep in mind that this will update some packages which may cause conflicts in your setup.**

You can check the list bellow and manually install your preferences without running setup_rlibs.R (which you can open however for guidance).

**Important Note:**
* **This installation was performed in a WINDOWS enviroment.** 
* **For a Linux installation there might be needed some manual installation of external dependencies (especially) for tidyverse. Please check libraries' documentation online**
* **For a MAC installation we engourage checking online**
