As the raw reads may contain low quality reads and or adaptor sequences, preprocessing is necessary before starting further analysis. Normally, data cleaning (or data filtering) is performed to obtain "clean reads" (or "clean data") for further analysis.,As there are some adaptor sequences and/or low quality reads present in the raw reads, data filtering is carried out to obtain high quality reads as the clean reads (clean data). The procedure include following steps:1. Remove reads with adaptor sequences.  2. Remove reads in which the percentage of unknown bases (N) is greater than 10%.  3. Remove low quality reads. If the percentage of the low quality base (base with quality value â¤ 5) is greater than 50% in a read, we define this read as low quality.,Clean reads are the high quality sequences after data cleaning, on which all following analyses are based.,Clean reads were mapped to reference sequences and/or reference gene set using SOAPaligner/SOAP2[1]. No more than 2 mismatches were allowed in the alignment.,The expression level for each gene is determined by the numbers of reads uniquely mapped to the specific gene and the total number of uniquely mapped reads in the sample(see 3.2.7.2 for details). The related information of gene is also provided (Coverage, Symbol, Description and so on).,Genome_build: mm9,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Text files include RPKM values for each Sample	Trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit,The total RNA samples are first treated with DNase I to degrade any possible DNA contamination. Then the mRNA is enriched by using the oligo(dT) magnetic beads (for eukaryotes). Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA is fragmented into short fragments (about 200 bp). Then the first strand of cDNA is synthesized by using random hexamer-primer. Buffer, dNTPs, RNase H and DNA polymerase I are added to synthesize the second strand. The double strand cDNA is purified with magnetic beads. End reparation and 3'-end single nucleotide A (adenine) addition is then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors are ligated to the fragments. The fragments are enriched by PCR amplification. During the QC step, Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System are used to qualify and quantify of the sample library. The library products were sequenced via Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 (SE50).

Library construction was performed in a 96-well plate format. First, to open secondary RNA structures and allow annealing of the RT primer, the samples were incubated at 72ËC for 3 min and immediately transferred to 4ËC. Then, RT reaction mix (10 mM DTT, 4 mM dNTP, 2.5 U/Âµl Superscript III RT enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2) was added into each well of the 96-well plate and the reaction was mixed. The 96-well plate was then spun down and moved into a cycler (Eppendorf) for the following incubation: 2 min at 42ËC, 50 min at 50ËC, 5 min at 85ËC. Indexed samples with equivalent amount of cDNA were pooled.Â  The pooled cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA with a second strand synthesis kit (NEB) in a 20Âµl reaction, incubating for 2.5 h at 16ËC. The product was purified with 1.4x volumes of SPRI beads, eluted in 8 Âµl and in-vitro transcribed (with the beads) at 37ËC overnight for linear amplification using the T7 High Yield RNA polymerase IVT kit (NEB). Following IVT, the DNA template was removed with Turbo DNase I (Ambion) 15 min at 37ËC and the amplified RNA (aRNA) purified with 1.2x volumes of SPRI beads. Library preparation for high-throughput sequencing: The aRNA was chemically fragmented into short molecules (median size ~200 nucleotides) by incubating 3 min at 70ËC in Zn2+ RNA fragmentation solution (Ambion) and purified with two volumes of SPRI beads. The aRNA (5 Âµl) was preincubated 3 min at 70ËC with 1 Âµl of 100 ÂµM ligation adapter; then, 14 Âµl of a mix containing 9.5% DMSO, 1 mM ATP, 20% PEG8000 and 1 U/Âµl T4 ligase in 50 mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1mM DTT was added. The reaction was incubated at 22ËC for 2 h. The ligated product was reverse transcribed using Affinity Script RT enzyme (Agilent; reaction mix contains Affinity Script RT buffer, 10 mM DTT, 4 mM dNTP, 2.5 U/Âµl RT enzyme) and a primer complementary to the ligated adapter. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 42ËC, 45 min at 50ËC and 5 min at 85ËC.Â  The cDNA was purified with 1.5x volumes of SPRI beads. The library was completed and amplified through a nested PCR reaction with 0.5 ÂµM of P5_Rd1 and P7_Rd2 primers and PCR ready mix (Kapa Biosystems). The forward primer contains the Illumina P5-Read1 sequences and the reverse primer contains the P7-Read2 sequences.

Cell lysates were thawed and mRNA was captured with 12 ul of Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Life technologies), and washed according to manufacture guidelines. Purified messenger RNA was eluted at 70Â°C with 10 ul of 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and stored at -80Â°C,cDNA was generated from 1ul of mRNA of each sample. cDNA quantity in each sample was evaluated by qPCR for Actin B gene, and then equivalent amounts of mRNA of each sample were taken for RNAseq library construction. Library construction was performed in a 96-well plate format. First, to open secondary RNA structures and allow annealing of the RT primer, the samples were incubated at 72ËC for 3 min and immediately transferred to 4ËC. Then, RT reaction mix (10 mM DTT, 4 mM dNTP, 2.5 U/Âµl Superscript III RT enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2) was added into each well of the 96-well plate and the reaction was mixed. The 96-well plate was then spun down and moved into a cycler (Eppendorf) for the following incubation: 2 min at 42ËC, 50 min at 50ËC, 5 min at 85ËC. Indexed samples with equivalent amount of cDNA were pooled.Â  The pooled cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA with a second strand synthesis kit (NEB) in a 20Âµl reaction, incubating for 2.5 h at 16ËC. The product was purified with 1.4x volumes of SPRI beads, eluted in 8 Âµl and in-vitro transcribed (with the beads) at 37ËC overnight for linear amplification using the T7 High Yield RNA polymerase IVT kit (NEB). Following IVT, the DNA template was removed with Turbo DNase I (Ambion) 15 min at 37ËC and the amplified RNA (aRNA) purified with 1.2x volumes of SPRI beads. Library preparation for high-throughput sequencing: The aRNA was chemically fragmented into short molecules (median size ~200 nucleotides) by incubating 3 min at 70ËC in Zn2+ RNA fragmentation solution (Ambion) and purified with two volumes of SPRI beads. The aRNA (5 Âµl) was preincubated 3 min at 70ËC with 1 Âµl of 100 ÂµM ligation adapter; then, 14 Âµl of a mix containing 9.5% DMSO, 1 mM ATP, 20% PEG8000 and 1 U/Âµl T4 ligase in 50 mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1mM DTT was added. The reaction was incubated at 22ËC for 2 h. The ligated product was reverse transcribed using Affinity Script RT enzyme (Agilent; reaction mix contains Affinity Script RT buffer, 10 mM DTT, 4 mM dNTP, 2.5 U/Âµl RT enzyme) and a primer complementary to the ligated adapter. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 42ËC, 45 min at 50ËC and 5 min at 85ËC.Â  The cDNA was purified with 1.5x volumes of SPRI beads. The library was completed and amplified through a nested PCR reaction with 0.5 ÂµM of P5_Rd1 and P7_Rd2 primers and PCR ready mix (Kapa Biosystems). The forward primer contains the Illumina P5-Read1 sequences and the reverse primer contains the P7-Read2 sequences. The amplified pooled library was purified with 0.7x volumes of SPRI beads to remove primer leftovers.

The reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using HISAT2 with the parameters '--dta-cufflinks -p 4 -k 5 -X 800 --sp 1000,1000'. Uniquely mapped reads were selected using the bamtools âfilterâ command with the parameters '-isMapped true -tag NH:1' and samtools âviewâ command with the parameter â-q 40â. BigWig files were generated using deepTools (version 2.2.4). The transcript-level expression levels were quantified using sailfish (version 0.9.2). The transcript-level expression levels were also calculated using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.6) with the parameters '-k 100 -X 800' and eXpress (version 1.5.1) with the parameter '--no-bias-correct'.,For each scRNA-seq method data with 10 pg of diluted RNA, fastq-mcf (version 1.04.807) was used to trim adapter sequences and generate read lengths of 42 nt with the parameters â-L 42 -l 42 -k 4 -q 30 -Sâ. For comparison, we also prepared R1 reads of rdRNA-seq and paRNA-seq data. The reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using HISAT2 (version 2.0.1) with parameters â--dta-cufflinks -p 4 -k 5 --sp 1000,1000â. Uniquely mapped reads were selected using the bamtools (version 2.0.1;) 53 âfilterâ command with the parameters `-isMapped true -tag NH:1` and the samtools (version 2.0.1)54 âviewâ command with the parameter â-q 40â. BigWig files were generated using deepTools (version 2.2.4). Sailfish (version 0.9.2) was used to quantify transcript-level expressions.,For bulk poly(A) and total RNA-seq data, fastq-mcf was used to trim adapter sequences with the parameters â-l 50 --lowcomplex-pct 36 --homopolymer-pct 36 -k 4 -Sâ. The reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using HISAT2 with the parameters '--dta-cufflinks --rna-strandness RF -k 5 --no-mixed --no-discordant --sp 1000,1000'. Properly (i.e., convergent read pairs) and uniquely mapped reads were selected using the bamtools âfilterâ command and samtools âviewâ command with the parameter â-q 40â. For genome-guided transcriptome assembly, Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) was used with the parameters â--multi-read-correct --frag-bias-correct -M $mask --library-type fr-unstrandedâ. A GTF file of tRNA and rRNA annotations in GENCODE (vM9) were provided to mask the genome. Cuffcompare was used to annotate transcripts with transfrag class codes with respect to the GENCODE (vM9) annotation. According to the Cuffcompare class codes, we selected (1) unnannotated transcripts with class codes of "i", "o", "u", "x", or "s" and (2) unannotated splicing variant transcripts (âjâ class (potentially novel isoform)) with at least one unannotated splice junction. We then removed (1) unannotated transcripts with exons located within 100 bp of the tRNA or rRNA annotations in GECODE or RepeatMasker, or pseudogene annotations in GENCODE (â2wayconspseudosâ), and (2) unannotated transcripts with lengths that were not monger than 200 bp. These filtered unannotated gene models were further merged with gene models in GENCODE vM9.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: txt, gtf, bigWig	Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA-seq, depletion of rRNA from 1 Âµg of ES total RNA was performed by using GeneRead rRNA Depletion Kits (Qiagen). For single-cell RamDA-seq, single cells were directly sorted into the cell lysis buffer containing RNasein plus (Promega), Cell Lysis Buffer (Roche), NP40 (Thermo), and RNase free water (TaKaRa). For averaged G1-phase cell lysate sample, 180 cells were sorted into 180 Âµl of the cell lysis buffer and individually divided into 1 Î¼l in a 96-well PCR plate after well-mixing to lyse the cells. The cell lysate solution was stored at -80ÂºC until use.,For bulk RNA-seq, the libraries were constructed by using a commercial kit (NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina; NEB) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, with slight modifications during the reverse-transcription and PCR steps. SMART-Seq v4 libraries were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions accompanying the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clontech). For library construction of RamDA-seq and C1-RamDA-seq, refer to the protocol in "Single-cell full-length total RNA sequencing uncovers dynamics of non-polyadenylated RNAs, recursive splicing and enhancer RNAs". For rRNA-depleted RNA-seq using 1 and 10 ng of diluted total RNA, sequencing libraries were prepared with KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase (Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. C1-SMART-Seq v4 libraries were prepared using Fluidigm C1 with the script "Full-length mRNA Sequencing" was downloaded from Script Hub (https://jp.fluidigm.com/c1openapp/scripthub)in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. For analyses of plate-to-plate variability (batch effect) of RamDA-seq, we prepared RamDA-seq library DNA by using the advanced method of RamDA-seq (refer to the protocol in "Single-cell full-length total RNA sequencing uncovers dynamics of non-polyadenylated RNAs, recursive splicing and enhancer RNAs").

Briefly, after removal of Illumina adapter sequences with cutadapt, RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC mm10) assembly using STAR with default parameters. Post alignment quantification was performed with featureCount. Read count data were then transformed with the variance stabilizing method from DESeq2.,WGBS data: (1) Quality control: quality trimming and adapter trimming of bisulfite sequencing data were done using Bismark v.0.19.0 with default parameters. Alignment and methylation calling of reads were also done using Bismark v.0.19.0. (2) Mapping: Methylation data were analysed using BiSeq v.1.18.0, CpG clusters were defined by 20 CpG sites covered in the majority of samples (3 out of 4), with a max. distance of 100 base pairs to nearest CpG cluster. (3) Differentially methylated regions: If methylation differences exceeded over 30% between the samples, differentially methylated regions were identified. (4) SuperDMRs: were defined by merging DMR together with at maximum distance of 100 base pairs to their nearest DMR neighbour.Â SuperDMRs were annotated to genes and enhancers by means of Granges object. In case of any overlaps the superDMRs were identified in genes/enhancers,sc RNA seq data: bcl2fastq/2.15.0.4  Sequences with RMT of low quality (defined as RMT with minimum Phred score of less than 27) were filtered out.  Pool-barcode and well-barcode-RMT were extracted from the first and second end of the read (respectively) and concatenated to the fastq header, delimited by a underscore i.e. POOL_BARCODE_WELL_BARCODE_RMT while "NNNNNN" was used as a place holders if plate barcode was not used.  Reads were separated by POOL_BARCODE_WELL_BARCODE header data, allowing 1 sequencing error. This process created a single fastq file for each source well.

The transcriptome contained all RefSeq gene models based on the mouse genome release mm10 downloaded from the UCSC genome browser and contained 31,109 isoforms derived from 23,480 gene loci. All isoforms of the same gene were merged to a single gene locus.,The right mate of each read pair was mapped to the ensemble of all gene loci. Reads mapping to multiple loci were discarded. The left read contains the barcode information: the first eight bases correspond to a sample specific barcode. The remainder of the left read contains a polyT stretch followed by few (<15 transcript derived bases).,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: .csv file containing transcript count	YS were carefully collected and vitelline vessels were cut off. After removal of the head and tail, the blood was flushed away by injecting PBS/FCS/PS or antibodies with a glass capillary directly inside the aorta of the embryo trunk.  Aorta-Gonad-Mesonephros (AGM) regions were dissected, pooled and dissociated by collagenase treatment (0.125% collagenase type I in PBS/FCS/PS) for 1 hour at 37Â°C. After dissociation, cells were washed, stained with various antibodies. Cells were sorted with a FACS Aria III flow cytometer. Single whole (w)IAHCs were mechanically picked-up from live thick embryo slices by using a CellCelector mechanical cell-picker. Location (dorsal or ventral) of the picked wIAHC was recorded.,Single cells were sorted in the wells of 96-well PCR plates, each well containing 100ml of TRIzol reagent and 0.2ul of a 1:250,000 dilution of ERCC spike ins (Thermo Fisher). wIAHCs were collected after pick-up in tubes containing the above solution. Total RNA was extracted from single cells, according to TRIzol manufacturerâs instructions (Thermo Fisher) with few alterations. GlycoBlue reagent (0.2Î¼l) was added to each sample to facilitate RNA precipitation. After overnight isopropanol precipitation, RNA pellets were air dried for up to 15 minutes, and suspended in CEL-Seq first-strand primer solution,Single cells (or wIAHCs) RNA obtained after TRIzol extraction was suspended in primer solution, denatured at 70ËC for 2 minutes and quickly chilled. First strand synthesis was carried out at 42ËC for 1 hour followed by a second strand synthesis step at 16ËC for 1 hour. cDNA was cleaned-up and in vitro transcription was set-up overnight at 37ËC. Amplified RNA was fragmented and cleaned-up for 3â adapter ligation, reverse transcription reaction and PCR amplification. Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 2500 by using 75 bp paired end sequencing.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

227	513070587	1	donor_genotype: Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre/wt;Ai14(RCL-tdT)/wt,injection_type: No Injection,tissue: Anterior Lateral Motor Cortex (ALM)	615 Westlake Ave N	Seattle	USA	The Allen Institute for Brain Science	Allen,,Institute		50-base pair paired-end reads were aligned to GRCm38 (mm10) using a RefSeq annotation gff file retrieved from NCBI on 01/18/2016 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all/). Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016).

231	693381541	1	donor_genotype: Snap25-IRES2-Cre/wt;Ai14(RCL-tdT)/wt,injection_type: No Injection,tissue: Anterior Lateral Motor Cortex (ALM)	615 Westlake Ave N	Seattle	USA	The Allen Institute for Brain Science	Allen,,Institute		50-base pair paired-end reads were aligned to GRCm38 (mm10) using a RefSeq annotation gff file retrieved from NCBI on 01/18/2016 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all/). Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

251	605806745	1	donor_genotype: Snap25-IRES2-Cre/wt;Ai14(RCL-tdT)/wt,injection_type: No Injection,tissue: Primary Visual Cortex (VISp)	615 Westlake Ave N	Seattle	USA	The Allen Institute for Brain Science	Allen,,Institute		50-base pair paired-end reads were aligned to GRCm38 (mm10) using a RefSeq annotation gff file retrieved from NCBI on 01/18/2016 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all/). Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (Dobin et al., 2013) in twopassMode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option âbamRemoveDuplicatesâ. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R GenomicAlignments package (Lawrence et al., 2013) sumarizeOverlaps function using âIntersectionNotEmptyâ.,Cells with fewer than 2,000 detected genes (count > 0) and less than 30% of reads mapped to the transcriptome were removed. Doublets were removed by first classifying cells into broad classes of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal based on known markers. For each class, we selected highly specific genes that are only present in this class against all other classes, and computed the eigengene (the first principle component based on the given gene set). Eigengenes for all classes were normalized in the range of 0 and 1, and we removed any cells that scored > 0.2 in more than one class.,We mapped all non-genome-mapped reads to sequences in Extended Data Table 6 (Tasic et al., 2018). To avoid ambiguous counting due to stretches of sequence identity, we designated unique regions within these sequences to count mRNAs of interest. We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001).

We counted only reads for which at least one of the paired ends had an overlap with the unique regions of at least 10 bp.,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content:,cells_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of non-control samples,controls_*_counts.csv.gz: matrix file of exon or intron counts of control samples	We isolated single cells as previously described (Hempel et al., 2007; Sugino et al., 2006; Tasic et al., 2016) with modifications. We mostly employed layer-enriching dissections, with focus on a single layer. Broader dissections (no layer enrichment or multiple layers combined) were employed for lines which label small numbers of cells, in order to facilitate isolation of sufficient number of cells. We updated our ACSF formulation to consist of CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (25 mM), HCl (96 mM), HEPES (20 mM), MgSO4 (10 mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25 mM), myo-inositol (3 mM), N-acetylcysteine (12 mM), NMDG (96 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), sodium L-ascorbate (5 mM), sodium pyruvate (3 mM), taurine (0.01 mM), thiourea (2 mM), and bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2 and 5% CO2). For samples collected after 12/16/2016, the ACSF formulation also included trehalose (13.2 mM). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with cold carbogen-bubbled ACSF. The brain was dissected, submerged in ACSF, embedded in 2% agarose, and sliced into 250-Âµm coronal sections on a compresstome (Precisionary). Enzymatic digestion, trituration into single cell suspension, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of single cells were carried out as previously described (Tasic et al., 2016). Cells were sorted into 8-well strips containing lysis buffer from SMART-Seq v4 kit with RNase inhibitor (0.17 U/Âµl), immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C.,We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Cat#634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify cDNA according to the manufacturerâs instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 18 PCR cycles in 8-well strips, in sets of 12-24 strips at a time. At least 1 control strip was used per amplification set, which contained 4 wells without cells and 4 wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Mouse Whole Brain Total RNA (Zyagen, MR-201) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131-1096) using NexteraXT Index Kit V2 Set A (FC-131-2001). NexteraXT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufactorerâs instructions except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.4Ã or 0.5Ã by volume.

Briefly, reads were trimmed of adapter sequences associated with the Library Prep Kit using TrimGalore!, v0.5.0.  Trimmed reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using HISAT2 (v2.0.5) and transcript counts were determined using Stringtie (v2.0.4).,For single cell RNAseq; Digital gene expression matrices were generated with the Cell Ranger Pipeline v3.1 and aligned to the mm10-2020-A reference transcriptome. The resulting digital gene expression matrix was filtered, normalized, and clustered using R 4.0.2 and Seurat 3.2.145,46, as per MacParland et al.47. Briefly, features that were detected in less than 3 cells and cells with less than 200 features were excluded.   We further filtered out cells with greater than 5000 transcripts or a mitochondrial transcriptome of >25%.  Normalization was performed using LogNormalize feature with a scale factor of 100000.  PCA was performed on the top 2000 variable features that were identified using the âvstâ selection method. This resulted in 4298 and 5396 cells for the non-BMT and BMT datasets, respectively.  The non-BMT and BMT datasets were integrated using the Harmony algorithm48 based on the first 15 principal components.
